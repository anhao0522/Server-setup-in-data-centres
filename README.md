# Server-setup-in-data-centres
This is a system simulation. Project of Capacity Planning of Computer systems and Networks.
This project has two parts. One is to build a system simulation, which has trace and random modes. 
Another is design part. Determining a suitable value of Tc, which is the value of the countdown timer. Suitable Tc can save much energy when system is running. That is to say, when server is idle, we can shut down it to save energy. This part is to use this system simulation to determine a suitable Tc for this specific system.
